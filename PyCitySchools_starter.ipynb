    "# PyCity School District Performance Analysis\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "Standardised tests are used to measure the performance of schools. Math and Reading are two components of these standardised exams. In this study, the contributions of three factors (school type, budget per student, and school size) were explored in terms of their associations with rates of passing Math and Reading tests, and scores from these tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "There were three key takeaways generated from the performance analysis. First, the number of students (school size) explained 67–71% of the variance in the performance indicators. Classifying the schools into size categories showed the contrasts even more clearly: small and medium schools performed better than large schools. Second, there was a strong linear relationship between school size and budget. However, an increase in either budget or budget per student did not seem to be linked with improved school performance. Third, charter school appeared to have performed much better than district schools in the standardised tests. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before making actionable insights based from these takeaways, it is important to take note that the variables that contribute to school performance were largely incomplete. There was no information on school facilities and on student-teacher ratios, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The PyCity School District is composed of 15 schools that could be classified as either \"charter\" or \"district\" schools. There was a total of 39,170 students in this district, from 9th to 12th grade (secondary school; Corsi-Bunker 2018), who underwent the standardised exam. The exam is composed of two sections, Mathematics and Reading. The objective of this study was to identify trends from the students' performances and to generate insights that could lead towards strategic decisions at the district level.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods\n",
    "The scores of each examinee were encoded into two .csv files. The data included school names, types, budgets, and sizes (schools_complete.csv); as well student names, genders, and scores in the two components of the standardised exam (students_complete.csv). Python (version 3.6) modules Pandas (McKinney 2010) and NumPy (Oliphant 2006) were used to analyse the data. SciPy and MatPlotLib modules (SciPy Community 2015; https://matplotlib.org/) were used to compare means and to visualise the data as plots, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The study looked at the trends based on school type, budget, and size. Student gender was not considered as a factor in student scores and in school performance. Student-teacher ratios were not included in the data included."

    "## Results\n",
    "### District Overview\n",
    "The data indicates that the PyCity School District reported a budget of USD 24,649,428.00. Only 65% of the students passed both Math and Reading Exams (overall passing; Betts et al. 2012). The Welch t-test suggests that there was no significant difference in the average scores for Math and for Reading. However, the passing rate for Reading was significantly higher than for Math."

    "### Reading Score by Grade \n",
    "The range of average scores for the Reading exam was shorter than that of the Math exam, which suggests that the students had similar proficiencies in Reading across grades. The Reading median score was lower in the 12th Grade than in the other grades, indicating that the 12th Grade exam was more difficult than the exams in the other grades. There are several possible reasons for this. A closer look at the 12th Grade Reading curriculum and exam contents may be key to explaining the students' performance."

    "Four groups were generated based on arbitrarily set categories of school spending per student. The results suggest that the schools that spent more per student had lower average scores for Math and Reading. A closer look at the data indicates that the differences for the Reading average scores was less than 2% while the differences for the Math average scores were around 6%. Are these values big enough to make a significant impact in performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the differences among the budget categories in terms of passing rates were clearer. The data suggests that the schools with higher budgets per student had lower passing rates, particularly for Math and for overall. Before making recommendations from these results, it is important to take a closer look at the data and other determining factors and school characteristics that were not included in the study."

    "The coefficient of determination indicates that 62–64% of the variance in student performance could be associated with the budget allocation per student. Indeed, budget per student is an important factor contributing to student performance. Hence, it is important to determine the breakdown of the school budget to dig out more factors that could influence student performance. It is possible that a significant proportion of a school's budget is allocated to extra-curricular programs, which could then be related to less funding going towards Math and Reading or to exam preparation. Devising recommendations just based on the available data, without understanding the budget breakdown, could lead to even more detrimental student performance."

According to the coefficients of determination, the school population size could explain 67–71% of the variance in the the exam results and in the passing rates. School size, it appears, was a major contributing factor to school performance. Could it be related with budget per student? Results indicate that only 41% of the budget per student could be explained by school size. There may be other factors that contribute to the budget per student; and these factors should be considered in developing actionable solutions to improve student performance in large schools."

Charter schools are independently operated and generally are able to customise their curricula, their staffing, and their budgets depending on the needs of the students and the missions of each school (National Alliance for Public Charter Schools 2018). On the other hand, district schools are required to follow a curriculum precribed by the state (Social Solutions 2018).\n",

The passing rate for the Reading exam was even higher (96%) in charter schools but the disparity with district schools, for the Reading exam, was lower. The average scores between the two school types were similar. In terms of overall passing rates, charter schools performed much better (90%) than district schools (54%). \n",

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "This study looked into school performance in two standardised tests, which covered Reading and Math. The trends explored in this study indicated that charter schools performed much better than district schools; the number of students was negatively correlated with school performance in the tests (average scores and passing rates); and that schools spending more per student performed more poorly than schools that allocated less funding per student.\n",
    "\n",
    "One may be tempted to use the trends generated in this study in making actionable solutions to improve student performance, such as reducing per student budget. Doing so may prove to be detrimental because the school profiles included in this study are largely incomplete. What this study shows clearly is a need to perform a closer inspection of school characteristics before making recommendations."
